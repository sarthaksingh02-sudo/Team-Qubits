# Requirements Document: SIDAR Learning Companion

## Introduction

SIDAR (Project Disha) is an AI-native learning companion platform designed to transform student learning from passive to proactive. The system addresses the core problem of students being overwhelmed by fragmented digital tools (YouTube, Discord, Google Classroom) by centralizing resources, scheduling, and collaboration in a single, context-aware dashboard. SIDAR provides an integrated ecosystem that manages the entire academic journey through AI-powered intelligence, dynamic organization, community collaboration, and integrated utilities.
